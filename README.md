# Image-Classification-Pneumonia-Detection
Pneumonia is lung inflammation caused by infection with virus, bacteria, fungi or other pathogens. According to National Institutes of Health (NIH), chest x ray is the best test for pneumonia diagnosis. However, reading x ray images can be tricky and requires domain expertise and experience. It would be nice if we can just ask a computer to read the images and tell us the results. In this story, This project will use deep learning to train an AI algorithm that analyzes chest x ray images and detects pneumonia.This algorithm is trained on a database containing normal and pneumonia images.
